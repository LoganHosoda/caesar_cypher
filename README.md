Caesar's Cypher, by Logan Hosoda.

The purpose of this program is to take any word/phrase
and replace each individual letter with another letter
that is a set amount of positions away in the alphabet.

As of now you can enter any word of any length, as well
as an offset to shift the word up to +/- 25 positions on
the alphabet.
